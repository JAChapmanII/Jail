jail is currently nothing. Yay!

WARNING: jail is starting to manipulate files. Use this functionality at your
own risk. The developers hold no responsibility for any and all files and
monetary loss the usage of jail causes you.

What will it be?
	Soon (I hope) it will be a rather bad clone of vim in C++. Further on, it
	will hopefully be a not so bad clone of vim.

Building (the nothing):
	A standard Makefile is set up, so simply issue
		make
	on any decently set up GNU/Linux machine

	See the Makefile for other options.

Running (the nothing):
	./bin/jl

Usage:
	Read what it says. Maybe the devs will make a man page. Or maybe the --help
	switch will actually provide some level of help in the future. Maybe.
