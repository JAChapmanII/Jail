jail is currently nothing. Yay!

What will it be?
	Soon (I hope) it will be a rather bad clone of vim in C++. Furthur down, it
	will hopefully be a not so bad clone of vim.

Building (the nothing):
	A standard Makefile is set up, so simply issue
		make
	on any decently set up GNU/Linux machine

	See the Makefile for other options.

Running (the nothing):
	./bin/jail

Usage:
	Read what it says. Maybe the devs will make a man page, or implement the
	--help switch. Maybe.
