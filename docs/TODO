We need to pick a license. The warning in the README isn't as strong as I would
like it to be.

Fix/remove all TODOs found in source files.

TODO should have actual TODO things in it.

Configuration needs to have attention drawn to it and talked about.
    Most of the functions in main should be elsewhere, as half are about
    configuration

Move non-configuration, non-main functions to some other file/class

We're using the return value of the Cursor's move functions to see if we
should try to scroll or not, however this has caused a dirty hack to be
implemented when we are merely moving down into a line shorter than where the
cursor was previously, in which we should not scroll. Is there a better way?

FileIO's write function, which is used through Buffer (which is obtained
through a Controller's view's getBuffer function, yay indirection!) is a
horrible hack. It most likely invalidates all assumed state. I don't know what
happens if you use it more than once. Or try to read from the FileIO
afterward. Yay!

When a file is opened which exists but is empty, strange things happen.
Investigation must happen.
