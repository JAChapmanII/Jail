To contribute to this project, please fork the project on Github.
After you make changes you'd like to see in the master branch, please
create a pull request.

We ask that all contributions follow this coding standard:

* Spaces are used in all cases. No tabs. Spaces. Four (4) of them.

* Opening curly brackets should appear on the same line as the
  function they are being called with. For example:

    if(four == 4) {
        // ...
    }

* camelCase is used, not under_lines. And yes, I realize underline is one word.

* A modeline should be added to the bottom of each file:
    // vim: ts=4 et sw=4 sts=4

* No line, with few exceptions, shall surpass 80 characters in length. Really.
